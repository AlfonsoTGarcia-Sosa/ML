Code and jupyter notebooks to run analysis and classification as in paper GarcÃ­a-Sosa A. T.* "Androgen Receptor Binding Category Prediction with Deep Neural Networks and Structure-, Ligand-, and Statistically-Based Features" Molecules 2021, 26:1285 (https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1285/htm), or file 


my_py_scriptMoreMetrics.py contains Random Forest and Deep Neural Network classifiers and regressors on the CoMPARA set of androgen receptor (AR) toxicity compounds using my own features. It runs using environment file deepch.yml. First create a conda environment with:

conda env create -f deepch.yml

Then

conda activate deepch

Then

python

and run my_py_scriptMoreMetrics.py
such as:
python my_py_scriptMoreMetrics.py > out.txt

The latest version of the notebooks have also text comments

roc_hum_dud.png, roc_chimp_dud.png, roc_rat_dud.png are ROC-AUC curves for Human, Chimp, and Rat AR docking with DUD-E created decoys. Respectively, AUC values are 0.80, 0.83, and 0.74. Enrichement factor EF(1%) for Chimp AR = 68.92
